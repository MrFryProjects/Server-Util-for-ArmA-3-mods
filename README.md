# Server-Util-for-ArmA-3-mods
Uses mod preset created in-game (.html) to download mods from steamcmd, move to appropriate dir, and create launch .bat

Place the ArmA 3 mod preset .html file, this IO_Community_Server_Utility.py file, and a config.txt file into an otherwise empty folder.
Run the script to produce a update .bat file and accompanying .txt file of steamcmd args, and a launch .bat file.

Script is programmed to our specific server constants. Changes to the env require updates to the script's vars.
